<h2 align = "center"> This repository contains code for detecting brain tumor in 2D MRI Images.</h2>

<h5> Description </h5>
<p>A tumor is basically an uncontrolled growth of cancerous cells in any part of the body, whereas a brain tumor is an uncontrolled growth of cancerous cells in the brain. The task of detecting these tumors can be automated with the use of Convoloutional Neural Networks(CNN). In this project I have used pretrained model MobileNetV2 for feature extraction and a fully connected layer to classify the cancerous and non-cancerous images. The data is first preprocessed and augmented before passing it to the neural network.</p>
